# A tool for optimizing the process of sequence analysis

## Motivation
Lake Michigan is one of the largest bodies of freshwater on the planet and freshwater bodies usually are 
populated by a lot of different microorganisms. But classifying these microbes can be difficult due to 
fragmented DNA, mutations, extensive database and computationally expensive algorithms used to match DNA sequences.

## Objective
In order to identify a sequence we have to perform sequence alignment on every possible match.
With this tool, we want to optimize the DNA sequence matching by providing a reduced number of candidates to sequence alignment match.
We measured our accuracy based on [Dr. Catherine Putonti sample collection from Lake Michigan](http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MF15172.htm).
